Data preprcessing:
    -> replace missing values with mean or median       +
    -> convert cathegorical values                      +
    -> check if target is balanced, if not fix it       +
    -> normalize the data!                              +
    -> split data into train-test 80:20                 +

Use 5-fold cross-validation on training!
