**Heart Disease Prediction – Cleveland UCI Dataset**

University of Aveiro – Complements of Machine Learning

This project focuses on binary classification of heart disease presence using the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset. We explore and compare the performance of various supervised learning models in predicting whether a patient has heart disease or not.

**Dataset**
We use the Heart Disease Cleveland dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cherngs/heart-disease-cleveland-uci?fbclid=IwAR1Zs9rCsFKeC8-kOWTJF9sP5vB5ThC3pgcBjArKtHnt_uhLcXcv2petlS8). The target variable is binary:

  -1: presence of heart disease
  -0: absence of heart disease

The dataset contains 14 features including age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG results, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, and more.

**Models Used**
We implemented and evaluated the following machine learning models:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- XGBoost
- Neural Network (MLPClassifier)

This project was developed for the **Complements of Machine Learning** course at the **University of Aveiro**.
